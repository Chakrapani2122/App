    The Soil Microbial Agroecology Lab (SMAL) at Kansas State University is dedicated to advancing soil health through comprehensive research on water efficiency, nutrient and energy balance, and climate change.

    **Vision and Mission**

    SMAL envisions sustainable agricultural systems that are productive, efficient in water, nutrients, and energy, resilient to climate change, and promote soil health. The lab aims to provide leadership in understanding soil microbial ecology in grassland and agricultural systems, applying this knowledge to optimize nutrient, water, and residue management for sustainable production systems that conserve resources and offer ecosystem services.

    **Research Focus**

    The lab's research is centered on three key areas:

    - Microbial Ecology and Processes: Investigating the microbial ecology, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) processes in grassland and agricultural ecosystems.
    - Soil Health Indicators: Identifying biological indicators of soil health and practices that sustain and enhance it.
    - Rhizosphere Microbes: Exploring the role and potential of microbes in the rhizosphere to boost plant growth and improve water and nutrient efficiency.

    **Research Areas**

    SMAL conducts research on:

    - Carbon and nitrogen analysis in different land uses.
    - Carbon and nitrogen mineralization.
    - Factors affecting soil fungi and bacteria populations.
    - Mycorrhizae population dynamics.
    - Effects of tillage, nutrients, and cropping systems on soil microbial populations.
    - Soil aggregate formation and stability.
    - Soil water infiltration capability.
    - Phospholipid fatty acids and neutral lipid fatty acids in soil organic matter.
    - Soil enzyme activity.
    - Stable isotope 13C and 15N analysis.

    **Leadership**

    The lab is led by Dr. Charles (Chuck) Rice, a University Distinguished Professor and holder of the Vanier University Professorship at Kansas State University. Dr. Rice is a Professor of Soil Microbiology in the Department of Agronomy and has received significant recognition for his work, including co-winning the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the United Nationsâ€™ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

    Through its research and leadership, SMAL contributes to the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices and the promotion of soil health.
