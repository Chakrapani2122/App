# 🌱 Soil Microbial Agroecology Lab (SMAL) – Kansas State University

The **Soil Microbial Agroecology Lab (SMAL)** at Kansas State University is dedicated to advancing soil health through comprehensive research on water efficiency, nutrient and energy balance, and climate change. 🌍💧⚡

---

## 🎯 Vision and Mission

SMAL envisions sustainable agricultural systems that are:
- 🌾 Productive
- 💧 Efficient in water, nutrients, and energy
- 🌡️ Resilient to climate change
- 🌿 Promote soil health

The lab aims to provide leadership in understanding **soil microbial ecology** in grassland and agricultural systems, applying this knowledge to optimize nutrient, water, and residue management for sustainable production systems that conserve resources and offer ecosystem services. 🌻🔬♻️

## 🔬 Research Focus

The lab's research is centered on three key areas:

1. **Microbial Ecology and Processes**  
   🧫 Investigating the microbial ecology, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) processes in grassland and agricultural ecosystems.

2. **Soil Health Indicators**  
   🌱 Identifying biological indicators of soil health and practices that sustain and enhance it.

3. **Rhizosphere Microbes**  
   🌿🦠 Exploring the role and potential of microbes in the rhizosphere to boost plant growth and improve water and nutrient efficiency.
